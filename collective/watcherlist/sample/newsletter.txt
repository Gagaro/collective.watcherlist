Sample integration: newsletter
------------------------------

We are going to use ``collective.watcherlist`` to create a simple
newsletter application.

- We will register an adapter from the default Folder content type to
  ``collective.watcherlist.watchers.WatcherList`` so people can
  watch this folder, meaning: they will get an email when something
  interesting happens.

- We will register an adapter from the default News Item content type to
  ``collective.watcherlist.watchers.WatcherList``.  Theoretically we
  could use this to let people watch this specific news item (like Poi
  offers for issues).  But in this case we will handle the watching on
  the parent folder level and use this adapter just to send an email
  about this news item.

- We will register an event handler to send an email to the watchers
  when a news item in the folder gets published.

- We will register a BrowserView for News Items, inheriting from
  ``collective.watcherlist.browser.BaseMail`` and use this to set the
  subject and contents of the email.

- We will create a form where an anonymous user can register with his
  email address.  We keep it simple, so no confirmation email is sent;
  this is left as an exercise for the reader and can be an interesting
  contribution.

- We will use the same form to let logged-in members subscribe
  themselves.

To see how this is done, look at the ``sample`` directory.  Here we
will run some tests.


We start a test browser session as anonymous user and open the
subscription form::

    >>> browser = self.browser
    >>> news = self.portal.news
    >>> browser.open(news.absolute_url() + '/@@subscription_form')
    >>> "Subscribe this email address to this folder" in browser.contents
    True
    >>> browser.getControl(name='email').value = 'guido@example.com'
    >>> browser.getControl(name='submit').click()

To ease testing a bit, we have defined a very simple browser view that
anyone can see and that shows the email addresses of the watchers::

    >>> browser.open(news.absolute_url() + '/@@subscription_overview')
    >>> print browser.contents
    guido@example.com

We log in as test user and subscribe too::

    >>> self.browser_login()
    >>> browser.open(news.absolute_url() + '/@@subscription_form')
    >>> "Subscribe this member to this folder" in browser.contents
    True
    >>> browser.getControl(name='toggle').click()

We check the results.  The current user is not actually reported, as
we assume he does not need to get an email when he himself does
something that triggers email sending::

    >>> browser.open(news.absolute_url() + '/@@subscription_overview')
    >>> print browser.contents
    guido@example.com

We might want to change that, or make it easier for others to change.

Anyway, we logout and see what gets reported now::

    >>> browser.open(self.portal.absolute_url() + '/logout')
    >>> browser.open(news.absolute_url() + '/@@subscription_overview')
    >>> print browser.contents
    guido@example.com
    testuser@example.com

We will be sending out emails, so first we make sure there are no
messages in our mock mailhost::

    >>> self.portal.MailHost.reset()
    >>> len(self.portal.MailHost.messages)
    0

Now we login as portal owner and publish a news item::

    >>> self.browser_login('portal_owner')
    >>> browser.open(news.first.absolute_url())
    >>> browser.getLink('Publish').click()

We have to watchers, so two emails are sent::

    >>> len(self.portal.MailHost.messages)
    2
    >>> print self.portal.MailHost.messages[0]
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/html; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: =?utf-8?q?Newsflash=3A_First_News?=
    To: guido@example.com
    From: admin@example.com
    Date: ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    <p>Have I got news for <em>you</em>!</p>
    >>> print self.portal.MailHost.messages[1]
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/html; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: =?utf-8?q?Newsflash=3A_First_News?=
    To: testuser@example.com
    From: admin@example.com
    Date: ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    <p>Have I got news for <em>you</em>!</p>
    >>> self.portal.MailHost.reset()
